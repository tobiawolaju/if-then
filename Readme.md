# Dominus Quant
>Turning John Does into Quants

**Dominus Quant**, is a high-fidelity on-chain trading intelligence protocol designed for the Deriverse ecosystem and beyond.

Our mission is simple:

> Turn retail traders into quants — and turn distributed intelligence into real trading infrastructure.

Hashquant is the analytics and narrative layer.  
Dominus Quant is the execution and intelligence layer.

Together, they form a decentralized quant stack.

## Core Feature — The Dominus Engine

Dominus Quant introduces a new primitive:

> A distributed market intelligence network powering a shared algorithmic trading pool.

Instead of relying on centralized trading bots, Dominus Quant uses:

- Edge devices as market sensors  
- Consensus-based signal aggregation  
- A centralized high-performance execution engine  
- On-chain pool accounting  

### How It Works

1. Users join the Dominus Pool by acquiring pool shares.  
2. Their device becomes an edge signal node.  
3. Devices monitor market structure (order flow, volatility, liquidity shifts).  
4. Signals are streamed to the Dominus Engine.  
5. The engine aggregates signals using weighted consensus.  
6. Trades are executed via the core risk engine.  
7. Profits are distributed proportionally to:
   - Capital contribution  
   - Verified signal contribution  

This is not copy trading. This is not HFT.  

It is:

> Mid-frequency algorithmic trading powered by distributed sensing.

## Narrated Analytics (Hashquant Layer)

Dominus Quant addresses the Deriverse Hackathon requirements by moving beyond static dashboards and into structured quant storytelling.

### Emotional Storytelling — The Quant Narrative Layer

We don't just show data; we narrate your edge.

Hashquant features a dynamic, lyrics-style portfolio review that transforms trading history into strategic feedback:

- **Session Alpha**: Identifies when you have edge (London vs NY sessions)  
- **Directional Bias**: Analyzes Long/Short imbalance  
- **Risk Resilience**: Narrates drawdown recovery behavior  

Trading becomes introspective, not reactive.

### Technical Rigor — Advanced Analytics

Powered by a custom on-chain indexer, Hashquant computes 13+ critical KPIs directly from the Deriverse Program ID (`CDESjex...`):

- Equity Curve & Drawdown (PnL velocity visualized via Recharts)  
- Fee Leakage Analysis (Protocol vs gas breakdown)  
- Profit Factor & Expectancy (Statistical modeling)  
- Win Rate Distribution & Trade Duration  
- Long/Short Ratio Bias Tracking  
- Symbol & Timeframe Filtering  

This is professional-grade analytics for retail traders.

### Smart Trading Journal

Every trade is automatically indexed and enriched with a high-performance TradingView Lightweight Chart snapshot:

- **Trade Playback**: Replay market structure at entry  
- **Notes & Ethics**: Locally stored annotations (privacy-first design)  
- **Behavioral Pattern Recognition**

## Distributed Intelligence Network

Dominus Quant extends beyond dashboards. It introduces a distributed signal architecture:

### Edge Layer (User Devices)

- Market monitoring  
- Signal scoring  
- Structured data packets  
- Weighted reputation system  

### Core Engine

- Signal aggregation  
- Risk modeling  
- Position sizing  
- Execution routing  

### On-Chain Layer

- Pool share minting  
- Transparent accounting  
- Profit distribution  
- Governance expansion (future phase)

## Technical Architecture

Dominus Quant is built as a modular quant infrastructure stack:

### Frontend

- Next.js 16 (App Router)  
- Tailwind CSS (Abyss Dark Theme)  
- Zustand (Reactive Metrics Engine)  

### Charts

- `lightweight-charts` (Market playback)  
- `recharts` (Analytics visualization)  

### Wallet & Auth

- Privy (Embedded Wallets & Signer Bridge)  

### On-Chain

- `@solana/web3.js`  
- Custom Deriverse Indexer  
- Pool accounting contracts (Dominus Layer)  

### Distributed Signal Layer (Planned Expansion)

- WebSocket-based edge node streaming  
- Consensus scoring model  
- Risk-aware execution engine  

## Vision

Dominus Quant is not just a dashboard.

It is:

- A quant education layer  
- A distributed signal network  
- A shared capital engine  
- A step toward decentralized algorithmic infrastructure  

DQ Labs builds tools that turn participation into intelligence.
