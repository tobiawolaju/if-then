# IF·THEN  
### See the future your choices create.

**If·Then** is A personal consequence simulator that turns daily decisions into visible futures. other features includes daily routing crafting, direct routing query in natural language, auto synch with google calender

It helps people move from intention to action by making time, habits, and tradeoffs tangible.  
Not as motivation — but as cause and effect.

> If you keep living like this… then this is where you end up.

## Why IF·THEN exists

Procrastination isn’t laziness.  
It’s uncertainty.

Most people don’t change because the future is abstract.  
IF·THEN makes the future concrete.

Instead of asking *what you want to do*, IF·THEN shows you *what happens if you don’t* — and how small changes compound over time.

This is especially critical in environments where structure is weak and consequences are delayed.

---

## What IF·THEN does

- Transforms goals and habits into **branching future timelines**
- Shows **cause-and-effect** over days, weeks, and months
- Lets users **edit decisions** and instantly see downstream impact
- Turns time into something you can reason about, not just schedule

This is not prediction.  
It’s simulation.

## How it works

### 1. Timeline-first life model
- Time is represented as a continuous, editable timeline
- Days are treated like footage, not lists
- If it’s not on the timeline, it doesn’t exist

---

### 2. Natural language → structured time
Users speak normally:

> “I work late most nights and scroll till 2am.”

IF·THEN:
- Extracts habits, constraints, and patterns
- Places them on the timeline
- Builds a baseline life trajectory

---

### 3. Branching futures (core feature)
From the same starting point, IF·THEN simulates:

- **Current path** — no change
- **Improved path** — small discipline
- **Focused path** — enforced structure

Each future explains:
- What improves
- What breaks
- What compounds
- Why it happens

---

### 4. Edit decisions, not tasks
- Drag a habit → future recalculates
- Remove a behavior → timeline degrades
- Add structure → long-term stability appears

You don’t manage tasks.  
You manage consequences.

---

### 5. “Show me my future”
IF·THEN generates:
- A short narrated scenario
- Visual snapshots of key moments
- A causal explanation linking today → tomorrow

No prophecy.  
No fantasy.  
Just logic over time.

---

## What IF·THEN is not

❌ A to-do list  
❌ A habit tracker  
❌ A motivation app  
❌ A calendar wrapper  

IF·THEN does not ask what you *want* to do.  
It shows what you are *choosing* to become.

## Philosophy

- The future is not guessed — it is accumulated  
- Small decisions matter more than big intentions  
- Structure creates freedom  
- If you can see consequences, you can change behavior  

> Discipline works best when it’s visible.

---

## Use cases

- Beating procrastination through consequence awareness  
- Life planning in unstable or chaotic environments  
- Career and skill trajectory simulation  
- Habit impact visualization  
- Decision-making under uncertainty  

---

## Roadmap (high level)

- Gemini-powered long-horizon reasoning
- Real-time future recalculation
- Timeline playback (scrub through outcomes)
- Multimodal future summaries (text + visuals)
- Offline-first personal modeling

---

## Status

IF·THEN is an active experimental project exploring how AI reasoning can make long-term consequences visible — especially where external structure is weak.
